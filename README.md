# JSON File Manipulation
This Python script manipulates a JSON file containing information about different types of donuts.

## Description
The script reads a JSON file named ex5.json, searches for a donut named "Old Fashioned," and appends a new batter type ("Tea") to its existing list of batters. The updated JSON data is then written back to the file.

## Usage
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Ensure that the ex5.json file is in the same directory as the Python script (Pythonscript.py).
Run the Python script by executing the following command in your terminal:
Copy code
python Pythonscript.py
After execution, the script will update the JSON data in the ex5.json file and print the updated JSON data to the console.
JSON Structure
The ex5.json file contains an array of objects, where each object represents a type of donut. Each donut object has properties such as ID, type, name, price per unit (ppu), batters, and toppings.

## Output
After running the script, the JSON data for the "Old Fashioned" donut will be updated to include a new batter type ("Tea")
